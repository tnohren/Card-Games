# Card-Games
Card Games, such as Blackjack and Texas Hold 'em.
BlackJack.py and CardandDeck.py just added.
I plan on starting a Texas Hold 'em implementation soon, as well as improving BlackJack.


# BlackJack.py
Just updated to include most functionality as functions.
Soon to be added:
  1. Money/Coin tracking and betting.
  2. Saved game functionality
  3. Multiple player support

# CardandDeck.py
Includes the following:
  1. Card Class
  2. Hand Class
  3. Deck Class
Each of the above classes has appropriate methods (for example, deck includes a shuffle() method).
